Instead, look for a body of water such as a pond or river to crouch in.\n🌊 If there is no water nearby, find a depressed, cleared area with little vegetation, lie low to the ground, and cover your body with wet clothing, a blanket, or soil. Stay low and covered until the fire passes.\n🚭 Protect your lungs by breathing air closest to the ground, through a moist cloth, if possible, to avoid inhaling smoke."
