Evacuate early.\n🍃 Avoid areas downwind, and river valleys downstream, of the volcano. Rubble and ash will be carried by wind and gravity.\n🚪 Take temporary shelter from volcanic ash where you are if you have enough supplies. Cover ventilation openings and seal doors and windows.\n😷 If outside, protect yourself from falling ash that can irritate skin and injure breathing passages, eyes, and open wounds. Use a well-fitting, certified face mask such as an N95.\n🚘 Avoid driving in heavy ash fall."
